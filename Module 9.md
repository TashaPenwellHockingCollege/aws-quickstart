# Section 1: AWS Well-Architected Framework

Cloud architects engage with decision makers to identify w/ business goals and capabilities that need improvement.
    * ensure alignment between tech deliverables of a solution and business goals
    * work w/ delivery teams that are implementing the solution to ensure tech features are appropriate
    
## AWS Well-Architected Framework
    * guide for designing infrstructures that are 
        1. secure
        2. high performing
        3. resilient
        4. efficient
    * Consistent approach to evaluating and implement cloud architecture
    * Way to provide best practices that are developed through lessons learned by reviewing customer architecture
    * organized into 5 pillars
        1. Operatonal Excellence
        2. Security
        3. Reliability
        4. Performance Efficiency
        5. Cost Optimization
     * each pillar include a set of design principles and best practices
     
     
 # Section 2:  Operational Excellent Pillar
      *FOCUS:  
          -run and monitor systems to deliver busienss value
          -continually improve supporting processes and procedures
          
      *KEY TOPICS
           -managing and automating changes
           -responding to events
           -defining standards to successfully manage daily operations
           
      *SIX DESIGN PRINCIPLES
            1.  Performa operations as code
            2.  Annotate documenttaion 
            3.  Make frequent, small, reversible changes
            4.  Refine operations procedures frequently
            5.  Anticipate failure
            6.  Learn from all operational events and failures
            
     *Operational Excellence Questions
     PREPARE
          1.  How do you determien what your priorities are?
          2.  How do you design yoru workload so that you can understand its state
          3.  How do you reduce defects, ease remediation, and improve flow into production?
          4.  How do you mitigate deployment risk
          5.  How do you know that you are ready to support a workload
          
      OPERATE
          1.  How do you understand the health of a your workload?
          2.  How do you understand the health of your operations?
          3.  How do you manage workload and operations events?
          
      EVOLVE
          1.  How do you evolve operations?
